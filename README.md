# Quota

**Description**:  Quota is an iOS app built with React Native. Its purpose is to provide a nice interface for enjoy and manage Amazon Kindle highlights. Highlights are organized by book, but can also be tagged, searched, shared, and more.

This iOS app has a partner web interface which currently lives on [Heroko](https://glacial-mountain-4423.herokuapp.com). This is a Rails backend with an Angular frontend. This is a working version of what this project aims to simplify for mobile. This iOS app will talk to that Rails backend.

Main goals for Quota:

  - **Learn**: Building an iOS app using React Native.
  - **Enjoy**:  This scratches my own itch to have a nice, mobile way to enjoy my thousands of Kindle highlights.
  - **Collaborate**: Work with other developers who are also interested in supporting the project.
